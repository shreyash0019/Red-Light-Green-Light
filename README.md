# Red Light Green Light Game

This is a fun and interactive **Red Light Green Light** game built using **Angular**. The game follows a simple concept where players must stop when the light turns red and can only move forward during the green light. The goal is to stop exactly three times before the light turns red to win, otherwise, the game is over.

---

## **Game Rules:**
- **Green Light**: The player can move forward. The goal is to stop at the right moment before the light turns red.
- **Red Light**: If the player is still moving when the light turns red, it's **Game Over**.
- **Stop Condition**: If the player successfully stops three times before the red light, they win the game.

---

## **Features:**
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).
- **Start and Stop Mechanism**: Players click the "Stop" button to freeze movement.
- **Win and Lose Animations**: Celebration animation on winning and a dramatic animation when losing.
- **Sound Effects**: Music plays when the green light is on, and stops when the light turns red.
- **Multiple Rounds**: The player can play multiple rounds without restarting the entire game.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **Angular**: For building the front-end of the game.
- **HTML/CSS**: For styling and structuring the game.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and functionality.
- **Netlify**: For deployment.
